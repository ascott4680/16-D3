						<h2>Are There Correlations Between Income, Smoking, and Obesity Rates??</h2><hr>
						<p>Using the plot below we can see some clear correlations between income levels, 
							smoking, and obesity rates. It's really quite interesting!
						</p>
			  
						<p><h4>Income and Obesity</h4>One might think that people with money may be obese since 
							they've got access to more food. However it's quite the opposite, the data below shows 
							that people with a lower income have a higher rate of obesity. This could potentially be associated
							with many folks eating at McDonalds, or grabbing food at the drive-thru while on the go.
						</p>
			  
						<p><h4>Income and Smoking Rates</h4>Here's another one you might be surprised by. Since 
							cigarette prices are rising cross the nation you might think at first glance
							that those that smoke may make more money because they're the only people that can 
							regularly afford to buy packs of cigarettes. However you can clearly see the correlation between
							 smoking rate and lower income states.
